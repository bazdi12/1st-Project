    <p class="p1">Lemon</p>
    <p>Both honey and lemons are popular foods typically used to flavor dishes and drinks.
Honey is a thick, sweet liquid that is produced by honey bees and some other similar insects, though the type produced by honey bees is the most well known.
It is commonly used as a natural substitute for processed sugar and also has some therapeutic uses, such as treating skin wounds and burns (1Trusted Source).
Lemons are citrus fruits primarily produced for their tart juice. The pulp and rind can be used as well.</p>

    <p class="p2">Clover</p>
    <p>Clover honey is a popular, light-colored, mild-tasting honey variety that provides various vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It may offer powerful antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects. Though it's slightly healthier than table sugar, it should be used in moderation.</p>

    <p class="p3">Cotton</p>
    <p>Cotton flowers have a very short life – 5 to 7 days only. Even more short-lived is the nectar life – only day 1 of the flowers gives nectar to the bees. From next day onwards, the bees reroute themselves to the leaf-like floral part at the base of the actual flower and collect another nectar from here. The most impressive feat is that the honey harvested from the extra-floral nectar is exactly similar to the honey harvested from the flower. The honey is light in colour and the flavour is buttery with some juicy fruity undernotes. The honey is really sweet but gives a mild tingle at the back of the throat after consumption. The mild flavour makes it a great table honey.</p>
